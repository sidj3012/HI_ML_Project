We used the Libri-Trans dataset, for each utterance in the dataset, four components (quadruplet) are provided:

English Speech Signal: The audio recording in English from LibriSpeech.
English Transcription: The corresponding text transcription in English (from LibriSpeech). This is not to be used for direct speech-to-text translation tasks, as the goal is to translate directly from speech to another language (French), not via English transcription.
French Translation 1: The French text, aligned directly from the e-books.
French Translation 2: A second French translation, obtained using Google Translate from the English transcriptions. This provides a machine-generated translation for comparison.
